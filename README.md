Prueba TÃ©cnica 23People // MidLevel SRE DevOps // Pedro Sandoval

For the implementation of this project, I decided to use the slim micro framework and MySQL as the database engine.

The technologies used for this project are:

PHP 7.3
MariaDB
Apache 2.4
GIT
VIM
Linux Centos

For project development and control, git + github with 3 branches was used: dev, qa, master.

Continuous delivery will be done through a commit to the master branch, taking it to GCP through Cloud Run & Cloud Build

Once the project is in production, Apigee proxie will be used.
